	UNTESTED:
        ? Descrambling of protected application files with serial number.

	Missing functionality:
		- Only touching the uart when magic keys are held (all 3 btns?)
			Once the project is done the uart can be freed for C64 use.

SD/IEC IF:
	WORKING:
		+ Directory
		+ Pattern matching
		+ File type discrimination on pattern matching (load"*" will select the first loadable file)
		+ Diskmounting
		+ Auto diskmounting when load (optional; default is off)
		+ Path into D64
		+ Path into T64
		+ Loading from FAT

		+ Saving
		+ Killing the IF (to have a workaround for the speedloader issue)
		+ Correct PETSCII conversion
		+ Error messages
		+ Insertion of new card handling
		+ Automatic wildcard on filenames longer than basic can handle
		+ Path in volume header on directory
		+ Decent FAT error handling
		+ Ability to create an empty D64 (mounting an empty disk *use same function as menu)
		+ Reset command for SD/IEC IF and 1541
		+ Change address command 
		+ CBM dos compatible abbrevs.		
		+ Scratching stuff (files and dirs)
		
	UNTESTED:
		
	Missing functionality:
		- Correct file types (USR, SEQ, REL whatever on D64/T64 directory)
		- SEQ read
		- SEQ write
		- C128 burst protocol
		- Free space is incorrect
		- Nifty commands (CMD Harddisk?)
		- Saving when path is in a D64 or T64
			
	ISSUES:
	
		- CBM abbrev does not support unit in a special command eg. KILL0 -> K0 		

		~ Directory after first visit to the menu is wrong
			After having navigated a certain path the menu is evoked for the first time.
			When the menu exitted and the IEC directory is listed this has gone FUBAR.
			CAUSE: The menu chains disk change events. 
				The first visit to the menu is considered a disk change.
				Upon exit the SD/IEC IF is reinitialized. This should not be done.
				
		~ Some demos make the card hang
			Demo is ran. Card hangs up. The IEC is no longer operable and the menu not accessable
			Likeley cause; the IEC receives something and handles the command. This blocks.
			WILL NOT BE FIXED! USE KILL0
			
		~ System freeze on FC3 DOS"$
			Directory is listed but ready does not appear.
				load"$",9 has no problems!!!
			WILL NOT BE FIXED! THE IF DOES NOT WORK WITH FC3 AT ALL AND THIS IS ACCEPTED. USE AS DEV 10 OR 11

	FIXED:
		* Stand alone mode integration with IEC globals.
		* Makedir does not refresh dir. You must re-insert the card
		* 1541 kill1 command does not revive with init1	
		* FC3 opens the same channel without closing (runstop/restore) This is 
			not possible currently.  Change; just close and re-open.

		* The SD interface hangs up the C64 speedloaders (games)
			Reproduced using turrican.
			The multiloader suddenly hangs up the system. A softreset throws you back to basic where you can attempt 
			to access the SD interface. This will hang the system again.
			Removing the card from the IEC bus 'solves' the problem. Other drives are accessable again.
			Re-inserting the cable renders the bus unusable again.
			FIX: receive and transmit byte can now act on ATN.
			FIX2: software handling moved to firmware (VHDL)
			
		* Saving when path is other then root
			File ends up in root. Directory is reset to root 
			FIX: directory trace index was wrong, and the dir was unopened. Added an error state to prevent saving to D64/T64.

		* Emulated 1541 remains in error mode when new disk is inserted
			When the emulated drive has no disk and the directory is requested this result in error 74.
			After is disk is mounted (@xmnt:) the directory can still not be requested.
			This does not happen when using the menu to mount the floppy image.
			CAUSE: The toggling of write protect during mounting has no effect since the 1541 drive cpu is acting on the IEC line
					This line is under ATN while the SD interface performs it's action. This is perfectly legal.
					But the 1541 does not see it.
					In theorie if you can hold the line with another drive (like a booting 1581) and insert a disk into a real
					1541 this should be reproducable aswell :-)
			FIX:	When the SD interface is no longer addressed the drive wiggle is re-performed.
					ATN can still mess things up. But the chance is very slim it will do that. Under basic V2 this does not occur.

FAT FILESYSTEM:
	WORKING:
		+ Opening file with long name
		+ Creating a file with a long filename
		+ Creating a dir with long filename
		+ Most stuff ;-)
        + Opening directory with long name
	
	UNTESTED:
		\ Most stuff
		\ Error handling (no corrupted sdcard available yet)
		
	Missing functionality:
		- Get disk capacity in bytes
		- Insertion of new card handling
		- Write protection
			
	ISSUES:

    FIXED:
		*	Crap trailing long file names  (Seems an issue with folders only)
            FIX: added memset before calling f_readdir_lfn

1541 DRIVE:
	WORKING:
		+ Seems an exact copy
		+ Writing back the disk
		+ Write project handling
		
	UNTESTED:
		\ Most stuff ;-)
		
	Missing functionality:
		
    ISSUES:
		* 	Issues may arise when illegal opcodes are used
		
    FIXED:
        *   If no file was mounted, what does a write do?! -- nothing, because no writes are
            possible, as no disk is inserted in the drive. 1541 will indicate DRIVE NOT READY.

        *   Writing the last sector of track 35 causes further writes to fail. Bug in ff.c?
             Syncing caused the 'illegally' opened file to go to an error state, since
             the directory could not be updated. Disabling this fixed the problem.

        *   dirty bits should be cleared upon new mount!! (in case the old disk was
            not written back or write protected)
			
MENU:
	WORKING:
		+ Content list
		+ Browsing using nifty blue bar! (wow)
		+ D64 mounting
		+ D64 browsing
		+ PRG loading from D64
		+ T64 browsing
		+ PRG loading from T64
		+ Creating an empty D64
        + Saving the current 1541 disk image to a .d64 file
        + Creating directories
		+ Reset the 1541 drive, and/or selecting 1541 IEC address
		+ Insertion of new card handling
		+ Help function -> Scroller
        + Decent ff error handling
        
	UNTESTED:
		\ Most stuff :-)
		
	Missing functionality:
		- paged browsing (more files then currently in list (limited to mapper space))
		- printing the path somewhere		
		- D64 <-> other drive exchange via IEC
		
	ISSUES:
      	
       	* Using the C128 reset while in menu make strange things happen!!!
        
    FIXED:
		* Returning from menu alters VIC or CPU somehow
			Reproduced using Turrican.
			When the 'turn disk' appears a bar is under the text.
			Upon exitting the menu the bar appears at a random place on screen.

         -> Freezer rewritten. Now returns in the same cpu cycle, synched with screen.


	    * D64 create causes 6k file (oops). Turned out to be an uninitialized variable

    	* Config should somehow let somthing update the hardware. (For example 
		      1541 drive ID)

        * Drive indicator in title is obsolete

		* Help text in scroller no longer reflects user interface.

        * Border of questionbox has wrong color

        * String input box text is poorly readable (blue --> grey)

        * Delete of the last entry causes cursor bar to hit the scroller. 
        	Subtract one under complicated condition

        * Delete asks unconditionally. Empy dir still yields question. (also 
	        dir title of D64)

        * Run command might also need a FC3 kill.
            Cartridge kill upon PRG load has been implemented.

        * Run command should also mount the floppy.

		* sometimes the directory is empty or corrupted
			On the C128DCR the SDCARD (FAT12) is sometimes not read at all or the directory shows up garbaged.
			(while the character set seems in perfect order and is thus loaded. The 1541 was not checked)

            This was caused by the interrupt routine. Interrupt routines should NOT use the C-library,
            since the C-library uses some statics for temporary storage, and the software stack operations
            are not atomic.    

		* sound stays on in freezer mode
			oh that awfull noise! Perhaps turning the volume off/on would help.  (It does)

		* prg loading from D64 
			This does not work on the C128DCR at all!
			The system needs a COLD BOOT to recover. Resets no longer help!
            FIXED: Special C128-reset mode added to fpga and software.
		
MISC: (uncategorized)
	
	ISSUES:
			
    FIXED:
		* REU does not work correctly.

		*  SX-64 compatibility

		* C128 reset does not get the machine into C128 mode (worked on V1, problem with V2)

		* A cartridge reset while in freezer mode is lethal
			When in the freezer menu (not the FC3 freezer) a reset locks the system.
            FIX: Reset button disabled in freezer mode.

		* C128DCR cannot use the FC3 freezer
			Unstable distortion on screen. Menus can be navigated. Alot of functions make the machine crash.

		* C128DCR cannot get into C128 mode
			The powerup and reset work like the FC3 used to. BUT.....the C128 reset no longer gets the system
			to C128 mode. Instead it just goes to C64 mode as if the cartridge reset is used.
			On the FC3 the cartridge- and de C128- reset have different functionality.
            FIX: Fixed. Reset button activates cartridge; reset from slot does not.		
			
		* C64c compatibility with DMA!  (Crucial!)
		    The complete cartridge interface was rewritten. It's now clear and readable code (finally!)
		    Also, a document was created that describes the ins and outs of the cartridge port.

TODO:

Software:
* G41 support
* D81 browse support
* D71 browse support
* Standalone mode
* Option to flash new software -> done (not yet for appl.bin, should we do that from the menu?)

* Flashable appl.bin, such that not the whole 512K of memory needs to be flashed (and occupied), and flashing
    the appl.bin from a running system becomes possible.
* ACTUAL DRIVE SOUNDS!!

VHDL:
* Changes needed for G41 support? (variable track lengths etc)
* SDRAM Control  -> done
* SID (low priority, just want to tune the filters to be similar to 6581, not combined with 1541, separate fpga)
* REU (how do we combine this with Action reply or FC3??)  -> implemented, compatibility still an issue

Bugs:
